  <summary><strong>🎲 Assignment 2: Random Matrix Generation</strong></summary>

### 📝 Tasks
1. Use NumPy to create a 3×3 matrix of random integers between 1 and 50.  
2. Run the code twice:  
   - With a fixed seed (`np.random.seed(10)`) to ensure reproducibility.   
   - Without setting a seed, allowing random values to change each time.  
3. Observe and explain the differences in outputs (in a different cell as text).

### 📌 Concepts Covered
- Random integer matrix generation
- Effects of using fixed seeds in random number generation
