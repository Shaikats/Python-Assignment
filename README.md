  <summary><strong>🎲 Assignment 2: Random Matrix Generation</strong></summary>

### 📝 Tasks
1. Use NumPy to create a 3×3 matrix of random integers between 1 and 50.  
2. Run the code twice:  
   - Without setting a seed, allowing random values to change each time.  
3. Observe and explain the differences in outputs (in a different cell as text).

### 📌 Concepts Covered
- Random integer matrix generation
- Effects of using fixed seeds in random number generation

  <summary><strong>🎲 Assignment 4: Normal Distribution and Two-Sample t-Test</strong></summary>

### 📝 Tasks
1. **Task 1:** Randomly generate 50 values from a normal distribution with a chosen mean (μ1) and standard deviation.
2. **Task 2:** Randomly generate 50 values from a normal distribution with a different mean (μ2) and standard deviation.
3. **Task 3:** Perform a two-sample t-test to check if the means of the two samples are significantly different.
4. **Task 4:** Visualize the comparison using a boxplot.

### 📌 Concepts Covered
- Normal distribution sampling
- Two-sample t-test (Welch's test)
- Boxplot visualization
